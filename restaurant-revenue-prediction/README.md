Not the best competition I've done. Did very poorly on the private leaderboard (and on the public one too) and was very probably overfitting since the start.

The code in `model2.R` is the one I tried to finish before the end, with no success. It's mostly commented, but if you look at the [winning solutions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/forums/t/14060/please-share-your-codes/) I was waaaaay off with my approach.
