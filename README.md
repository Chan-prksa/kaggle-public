# My Kaggle Competitions

This public repository will contain my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/users/101878/jos-mar-a-mateos) solutions after the different competitions have ended. Typically I have my code on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), as they offer unlimited private repositories, but I am doing a manual copy over here as different competitions end.

So far, this is published here:

* [Galaxy Zoo](https://github.com/rinze/kaggle-public/tree/master/galaxy-zoo). [Original Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/rinze/kaggle-galaxy-zoo).
* [Restaurant Revenue Prediction](https://github.com/rinze/kaggle-public/tree/master/restaurant-revenue-prediction). [Original Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/rinze/kaggle-restrev).
* [Facebook Recruiting IV](https://github.com/rinze/kaggle-public/tree/master/fr4). [Original Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/rinze/kaggle-fr4).

More to come. Stay tuned.
